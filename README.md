# raytrace-weekend

ClojureScript code to go along with
[Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01B5AODD8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01B5AODD8&linkCode=as2&tag=inonwe09-20&linkId=OPNJXXJY2IBCMEGE) by Peter Shirley

## What is this?

Just a place for me to put together example code for the book. I decided to do
it in ClojureScript instead of C++ as a challenge (and because it seemed more
appealing to me to have the examples run in the browser.

You should check the book out if you are at all interested in ray tracing!
